## Why This Project?

Interviews are a crucial part of recruitment, but they can be intimidating. Here are some statistics that highlight the importance of preparation:

- **67%** of recruiters consider confidence levels a critical factor in candidate selection, and **39%** of candidates are rejected due to a lack of confidence.
- Maintaining **eye contact** creates a strong impression.
- **92%** of job seekers find mock interviews essential for interview preparation.

Our platform addresses these challenges by offering an interactive, AI-driven simulation experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Simulations**: Replicates realistic interview scenarios using advanced AI.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: Generates job-specific questions tailored to the candidate's input (e.g., role, skills, and industry).
- **Voice-Based Interaction**: AI conducts mock interviews, and candidates respond in real time using voice input.
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Identifies strengths and areas for improvement to enhance interview performance.
- **Advanced Tracking**: Features like face recognition, eye blink detection, and hand gesture tracking for better user insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for a modern, scalable interface.
- **AI/ML**: Mediapipe, OpenCV for interactive features.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Enables real-time voice response processing.
